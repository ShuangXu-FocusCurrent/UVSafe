<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![main_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24356388/132601039-32f351f9-21ec-4033-b1bb-ae461962ae8e.png)

 <p align="left">
    In recent years the elderly population of Australia has exhibited an increasing trend in incidence rate of Melanoma Skin Cancer since they grew up through their childhood without having adequate knowledge on sun protection and consequences of long term sun exposure. ("Melanoma rates on the rise in older Australians", 2021). Since it has been stated that exposure to sun during the first 15 years of life could increase the risk of  developing skin cancer later in life ("Sun Safety: Teaching Children about Sun Protection", 2021) the awareness about sun protection from childhood  has become significant.

<br />
Consequently, our goal is to help reduce skin cancer incidence rate in Victoria, Australia by educating young children on the importance of sun protection. With that respect this project was developed as a child-friendly mobile application with functionalities including
        <li> Retrive weather information for a selected location üîÖüå° </li>
        <li> Retrive information on sun protection measurements : Slipüëï, Slopüß¥, Slap üëí, Seeküå¥, Shadeüï∂ </li>
        <li> Set an alarm to remind re-apply sunblock ‚è∞ </li>
        <li> Recieve notification when UV level reaches 3+ ü•µ</li>
        <li> Access information about sun protection</li>
        <li> Access information about UV Radiation</li>
        <li> Access information about Sunscreen</li>
        <li> Access information about Melanoma Skin Cancer </li>
        <li> Test the understanding about sun protection with few quizes</li>
